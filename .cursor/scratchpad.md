# Polynomial SDK - NPM Package Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

Based on the existing builder code example repository, we need to create a comprehensive NPM package called "polynomial-sdk" that wraps around all the Polynomial Perpetuals trading functionality. The current repository contains:

1. **Core Trading Functions**: Market data fetching, account management, order placement
2. **Nitro Mode Integration**: Session key-based order signing and submission
3. **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
4. **Configuration Management**: Chain IDs, endpoints, and contract addresses

The goal is to transform this example code into a production-ready SDK that developers can easily install and use to integrate with Polynomial Perpetuals.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges

1. **Package Structure**: Need to organize code into logical modules with proper exports
2. **Type Safety**: Ensure comprehensive TypeScript support with proper type exports
3. **Configuration Management**: Allow flexible configuration while maintaining sensible defaults
4. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and meaningful error messages
5. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive API documentation and usage examples
6. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive test coverage for all functionality
7. **Build System**: Set up proper build pipeline for multiple output formats (CJS, ESM)

### Design Considerations

1. **API Design**: Should follow common SDK patterns with intuitive method names
2. **Authentication**: Secure handling of session keys and API keys
3. **Network Support**: Support for different chains/networks
4. **Bundle Size**: Keep the package lightweight for browser usage
5. **Backwards Compatibility**: Plan for future API changes

## Lessons

- The existing codebase has good separation of concerns with distinct modules for accounts, markets, orders, and configuration
- The code uses modern TypeScript patterns and includes comprehensive type definitions
- The Nitro Mode integration uses EIP-712 signing which is a standard pattern for off-chain order signing
- The current structure already follows many SDK best practices, making the transformation straightforward
