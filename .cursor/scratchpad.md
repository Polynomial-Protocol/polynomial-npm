# Polynomial SDK - NPM Package Development Plan

## Background and Motivation

Based on the existing builder code example repository, we need to create a comprehensive NPM package called "polynomial-sdk" that wraps around all the Polynomial Perpetuals trading functionality. The current repository contains:

1. **Core Trading Functions**: Market data fetching, account management, order placement
2. **Nitro Mode Integration**: Session key-based order signing and submission
3. **Type Definitions**: Complete TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
4. **Configuration Management**: Chain IDs, endpoints, and contract addresses

The goal is to transform this example code into a production-ready SDK that developers can easily install and use to integrate with Polynomial Perpetuals.

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Current Phase**: AUTHENTICATION FLOW FIXED ✅  
**Next Milestone**: Package is ready for publishing  
**Blockers**: None  
**Implementation Timeline**: Successfully completed in 1 session

### ✅ **Authentication Flow Issue Fixed**

**Issue Identified**: The `createMarketOrderWithSimulation` method was using undefined variables `sessionKey` and `walletAddress` instead of the stored instance variables.

**Problem Details**:

- Line 218: Used `walletAddress` without it being defined in method scope
- Line 260: Used `sessionKey` without it being defined in method scope
- Line 262: Used `walletAddress` again without being defined
- TypeScript configuration issues with Required<SDKConfig> making optional fields required

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Fixed Variable References**: Updated `createMarketOrderWithSimulation` to use `this.walletAddress!` and `this.sessionKey!` instead of undefined local variables
2. **Fixed TypeScript Types**: Created `InternalSDKConfig` type that keeps `walletAddress` and `sessionKey` optional while making other fields required
3. **Maintained Authentication Validation**: The `validateAuthentication()` method still properly checks that both credentials exist before order operations
4. **Preserved Error Handling**: All authentication errors are still properly thrown when credentials are missing

**Changes Made**:

- Updated `createMarketOrderWithSimulation` method to use stored instance variables
- Created new `InternalSDKConfig` type for better type safety
- Fixed all TypeScript linting errors
- All tests continue to pass (39/39 ✅)

**Current Authentication Flow**:

1. SDK constructor stores `walletAddress` and `sessionKey` from config (optional)
2. Methods that need authentication call `validateAuthentication()` which throws errors if credentials are missing
3. Order creation methods use the stored credentials (`this.walletAddress!`, `this.sessionKey!`)
4. If credentials weren't provided during SDK initialization, appropriate validation errors are thrown

### ✅ **Simulation Code Removed & Documentation Updated**

**Issue Identified**: User correctly pointed out that simulation functionality does not exist and should not be assumed.

**Actions Taken**:

1. **Removed Simulation Method**: Deleted `createMarketOrderWithSimulation` method from SDK class
2. **Removed Market Simulation**: Deleted `simulateTrade` method from Markets module
3. **Cleaned Up Types**: Removed `IPostTradeDetails` and `TradeSimulationParams` interfaces
4. **Updated Imports**: Removed simulation-related imports from all files
5. **Updated README**: Comprehensive documentation updates including:
   - Removed all simulation references
   - Added clear authentication section explaining session key and wallet address requirements
   - Updated examples to show proper authentication patterns
   - Added authentication modes (per-operation vs SDK-level)
   - Added error handling examples for missing authentication
   - Updated configuration examples with authentication credentials

**Documentation Improvements**:

- Clear explanation of authentication requirements for trading operations
- Examples showing both per-operation and SDK-level authentication
- Error handling patterns for missing credentials
- Updated configuration tables to include walletAddress and sessionKey
- Improved trading examples with proper authentication flow

**Current State**:

- ✅ No simulation code remains in the codebase
- ✅ All tests continue to pass
- ✅ Documentation accurately reflects actual functionality
- ✅ Authentication flow is clearly documented
- ✅ No linting errors

### ✅ **Correct Authentication Flow Implemented**

**Issue Identified**: The authentication flow was incorrectly implemented. Credentials should be required during SDK initialization, not passed as parameters to individual methods.

**Correct Implementation**:

1. **Required Credentials**: Made `sessionKey` and `walletAddress` required fields in `SDKConfig`
2. **Constructor Validation**: SDK constructor now validates and requires all three credentials:
   - `apiKey` (for API access)
   - `sessionKey` (for signing orders)
   - `walletAddress` (for trading operations)
3. **Method Updates**: Updated convenience methods to use stored credentials:
   - `createOrder(marketId, size, options?)` - no longer takes sessionKey/walletAddress parameters
   - `getAccountSummary()` - uses stored walletAddress
4. **Error Handling**: Clear error messages during SDK initialization if credentials are missing
5. **Type Safety**: Updated TypeScript types to reflect required fields

**Code Changes**:

- Updated `SDKConfig` interface to require `sessionKey` and `walletAddress`
- Enhanced constructor validation with detailed error messages
- Removed `validateAuthentication()` method (no longer needed)
- Updated `createOrder` method signature and implementation
- Updated `getAccountSummary` method to use stored credentials
- Fixed all TypeScript types and removed optional field assertions

**Documentation Updates**:

- Updated Quick Start example to show correct SDK initialization
- Revised configuration section to emphasize required credentials
- Updated all API method examples to reflect new signatures
- Enhanced authentication section with proper flow explanation
- Updated trading examples throughout the README
- Added credential security best practices

**Benefits**:

- ✅ Simpler API - credentials provided once during initialization
- ✅ Better security - credentials validated upfront
- ✅ Clearer error messages - fail fast during SDK creation
- ✅ Type safety - required fields properly typed
- ✅ Consistent behavior - all methods use stored credentials

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### ✅ **Account ID Fetching Enhancement Completed**

**Issue Identified**: User wanted the SDK to automatically fetch the account ID from the API when creating an SDK instance with session key and wallet address, instead of deriving it locally.

**Previous Implementation**: The SDK was using `deriveAccountId()` utility function to generate account ID locally using a hash of wallet address and chain ID.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Modified SDK Constructor**: Made constructor private and added `accountId` parameter
2. **Updated SDK.create() Method**: Made it async to fetch account ID from API during initialization
3. **API Integration**: Added API call to `/accounts` endpoint to fetch real account ID
4. **Error Handling**: Added proper error handling for cases where no account is found
5. **Removed Unused Code**: Deleted `deriveAccountId()` utility function since it's no longer needed
6. **Updated Tests**: Modified all tests to handle async SDK initialization

**Key Changes Made**:

- **SDK Constructor**: Now private and requires pre-fetched account ID
- **SDK.create()**: Now async and fetches account ID before creating SDK instance
- **Account ID Storage**: Account ID is fetched once during initialization and stored as instance variable
- **Orders Module**: Uses stored account ID via `this.getAccountId()` - no more fetching needed
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when account is not found for the wallet/chain combination
- **Test Updates**: All tests now use `await PolynomialSDK.create()` instead of `new PolynomialSDK()`

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **Real Account ID**: Uses actual account ID from Polynomial platform instead of derived hash
- ✅ **One-Time Fetch**: Account ID is fetched once during SDK initialization, never again
- ✅ **Better Performance**: No repeated account ID derivation or fetching during operations
- ✅ **Fail Fast**: SDK creation fails immediately if account doesn't exist
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Account ID is guaranteed to be available for all operations

### ✅ **Example Files and Documentation Updated**

**Issue Identified**: After making SDK creation async, the example files and README documentation were not updated to use `await` with `PolynomialSDK.create()`.

**Solution Implemented**:

1. **Fixed basic-usage.ts**: Updated to use `await PolynomialSDK.create()` instead of `PolynomialSDK.create()`
2. **Updated README Examples**: Fixed all 11 instances of SDK creation in README to use `await`
3. **Updated API Documentation**: Changed return type from `PolynomialSDK` to `Promise<PolynomialSDK>`
4. **Added Function Wrappers**: Wrapped examples in async functions where needed for proper syntax
5. **Fixed Missing Credentials**: Added required `sessionKey` and `walletAddress` to examples that were missing them

**Key Changes Made**:

- **examples/basic-usage.ts**: Added `await` to SDK creation on line 39
- **README.md**: Updated all SDK creation examples to be async
- **API Reference**: Updated return type documentation
- **Error Examples**: Fixed async/await usage in error handling examples
- **Environment Examples**: Updated environment variable usage examples

**Benefits**:

- ✅ **Correct Usage**: All examples now show proper async SDK initialization
- ✅ **No TypeScript Errors**: Fixed all compilation errors in examples
- ✅ **Consistent Documentation**: All examples follow the same async pattern
- ✅ **Complete Examples**: All examples include required credentials

**CREATE ORDER FUNCTION ENHANCED WITH DEFAULTS**: Successfully updated the createOrder functionality to have intelligent defaults for all parameters except marketId and size.

### ✅ **Enhanced Order Creation Completed**

**Key Improvements Made**:

1. **Updated OrderParams Interface**: Made `isLong`, `acceptablePrice`, and added `slippagePercentage` as optional parameters
2. **Added Automatic Market Price Fetching**: Orders now automatically fetch current market price when `acceptablePrice` is not provided
3. **Enhanced createMarketOrder**: Now provides intelligent defaults for all parameters except the required `marketId` and `size`
4. **New createOrder Convenience Method**: Ultra-simple method that only requires `marketId` and `size`
5. **Updated Existing Methods**: `createLongOrder` and `createShortOrder` now have optional `acceptablePrice` parameters
6. **SDK-Level Convenience**: Added `sdk.createOrder()` method for the simplest possible order creation

**Default Values Implemented**:

- **Position Direction**: `isLong: true` (defaults to long positions)
- **Acceptable Price**: Automatically calculated from current market price + slippage
- **Slippage**: Uses SDK default (10%) or custom value from parameters
- **Reduce Only**: `reduceOnly: false`
- **Settlement Strategy**: `"0"` (default strategy)
- **Referrer/Relayer**: Uses network configuration default
- **Allow Aggregation**: `true`
- **Allow Partial Matching**: `true`
- **Expiration**: One week from order creation
- **Nonce**: Auto-generated timestamp

**Usage Examples**:

```typescript
// Minimal - only marketId and size required
await sdk.createOrder(sessionKey, walletAddress, marketId, parseUnits("0.1"));

// With options
await sdk.createOrder(sessionKey, walletAddress, marketId, parseUnits("0.1"), {
  isLong: false,
  slippagePercentage: 5n,
});
```
