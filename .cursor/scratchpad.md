# Polynomial SDK - Limit Order Support Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to add support for limit orders to the polynomial-npm SDK package. Currently, the SDK only supports market orders through the `Orders` class. The limit order API endpoint is available at `https://orderbook-mainnet.polynomial.finance/api/limit_order/<market_id>` and follows a similar pattern to the existing market order implementation.

The goal is to extend the current SDK to support limit orders while maintaining consistency with the existing codebase architecture and patterns.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Current Market Order Implementation Analysis

- Market orders are implemented in `src/core/orders.ts` with the `Orders` class
- Uses EIP-712 signing for order authentication
- Submits to `market_order/<marketId>` endpoint
- Has comprehensive error handling and validation
- Supports slippage calculation and price protection

### Limit Order Requirements

- Similar structure to market orders but with different endpoint (`limit_order/<marketId>`)
- Requires `acceptablePrice` parameter (limit price)
- Same signing mechanism (EIP-712)
- Same validation and error handling patterns
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing SDK architecture

### Technical Considerations

- Need to create new types for limit order requests and signing
- Extend the `Orders` class with limit order methods
- Maintain consistency with existing API patterns
- Ensure proper TypeScript typing
- Add comprehensive tests

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Limit Order Types

- **Success Criteria**: New TypeScript interfaces for limit order requests and signing are defined
- **Details**:
  - Create `LimitOrderRequest` interface
  - Create `LimitOrderToSign` interface
  - Create `LimitOrderParams` interface
  - Add to `src/types/index.ts`

### Task 2: Extend Orders Class with Limit Order Methods

- **Success Criteria**: `Orders` class has new methods for limit order creation and submission
- **Details**:
  - Add `createLimitOrder()` method
  - Add `submitLimitOrder()` private method
  - Add `signLimitOrder()` private method
  - Add convenience methods like `createLimitLongOrder()` and `createLimitShortOrder()`

### Task 3: Update SDK Main Class

- **Success Criteria**: Main SDK class exposes limit order functionality
- **Details**:
  - Add convenience methods to `PolynomialSDK` class
  - Ensure proper error handling and validation

### Task 4: Add Tests

- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive tests for limit order functionality
- **Details**:
  - Unit tests for limit order creation
  - Integration tests for order submission
  - Error handling tests

### Task 5: Update Documentation

- **Success Criteria**: Documentation updated with limit order examples
- **Details**:
  - Update README with limit order usage
  - Add examples in docs folder
  - Update type definitions

## Current Status / Progress Tracking

**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**
**Next Action**: All tasks completed successfully

### Implementation Summary:

- ✅ Added limit order types (`LimitOrderRequest`, `LimitOrderToSign`, `LimitOrderParams`)
- ✅ Extended `Orders` class with limit order methods (`createLimitOrder`, `createLimitLongOrder`, `createLimitShortOrder`)
- ✅ Updated main SDK class with convenience methods for limit orders
- ✅ Added comprehensive tests for all limit order functionality
- ✅ Updated documentation with limit order examples and guides
- ✅ No linting errors detected

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

**✅ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - All limit order functionality has been successfully implemented and tested. The SDK now supports both market orders and limit orders with full TypeScript support, comprehensive error handling, and extensive documentation.
