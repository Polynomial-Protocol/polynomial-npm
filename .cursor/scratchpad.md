# Polynomial SDK - Post Trade Details API Implementation

## Background and Motivation

The user has requested to add support for the post-trade-details API endpoint to the polynomial-npm SDK. This API provides detailed information about the effects of a trade before it's executed, including fees, price impact, health factor, and feasibility.

**API Endpoint**: `https://perps-api-mainnet.polynomial.finance/post-trade-details?chainId=8008`

**Purpose**: Get pre-trade analysis including fees, price impact, health factor, and trade feasibility.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### API Requirements Analysis

- **Market Orders**: Require `accountId`, `marketId`, and `sizeDelta`
- **Limit Orders**: Require `accountId`, `marketId`, `sizeDelta`, and `limitPrice`
- **Response**: Comprehensive trade analysis including fees, health factor, liquidation price, etc.

### Current SDK Structure Analysis

- SDK already has `HttpClient` for API calls
- Has `Accounts` module for account-related operations
- Has `Orders` module for order creation
- Need to add new module or extend existing modules

### Technical Considerations

- Need to create new types for request/response
- Should integrate with existing SDK architecture
- Need proper error handling and validation
- Should be accessible from main SDK class
- Need comprehensive tests

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Task 1: Create Post Trade Details Types

- **Success Criteria**: TypeScript interfaces for request and response are defined
- **Details**:
  - Create `PostTradeDetailsRequest` interface for market orders
  - Create `PostTradeDetailsLimitRequest` interface for limit orders
  - Create `PostTradeDetailsResponse` interface for API response
  - Add to `src/types/index.ts`

### Task 2: Create Post Trade Details Module

- **Success Criteria**: New module with methods for post-trade analysis
- **Details**:
  - Create `src/core/post-trade-details.ts` module
  - Add `getPostTradeDetails()` method for market orders
  - Add `getPostTradeDetailsLimit()` method for limit orders
  - Implement proper error handling and validation

### Task 3: Integrate with Main SDK

- **Success Criteria**: Main SDK class exposes post-trade details functionality
- **Details**:
  - Add post-trade-details module to SDK constructor
  - Add convenience methods to main SDK class
  - Ensure proper error handling

### Task 4: Add Tests

- **Success Criteria**: Comprehensive tests for post-trade details functionality
- **Details**:
  - Unit tests for module methods
  - Integration tests for SDK methods
  - Error handling tests

### Task 5: Update Documentation

- **Success Criteria**: Documentation updated with post-trade details examples
- **Details**:
  - Update README with basic usage
  - Add examples in docs folder
  - Update type definitions
